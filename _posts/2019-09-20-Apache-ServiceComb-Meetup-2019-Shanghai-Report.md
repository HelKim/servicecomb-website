On September 20, 2019, at the Shanghai World Expo Center in China, the Apache ServiceComb community held microservice Co-Located event at the HUAWEI CONNECT 2019, that concluded successfully.

The event invited the chairman of the Apache Foundation, the chairman of the Apache Incubator Project Management Committee, Apache Member, Apache Committer, and Huawei Cloud PaaS team architect. They shared the "Apache Explained", "The Apache Incubator", "ServiceComb Incubating Journey", "Apache ServiceComb-Innovative Microservices", "HUAWEI CLOUD Microservice Tool Improves Development Efficiency", etc. Many micro-service technologies and experience. ServiceComb community has also released a series of innovative new projects to assist user solve pain points of microservice.

**Session 1: The Apache Way** 
  
The Apache Software Foundation is the world's largest open source foundation and currently has more than 300 open source projects covering big data, cloud computing, server and web frameworks, build management, content management, and the Internet of Things. Foundation members introduced the Apache Software Foundation, open source community governance principles, and the operating mechanism of the Apache incubator, and shared the Apache project's successful incubation experience with Huawei-funded project Apache ServiceComb.
